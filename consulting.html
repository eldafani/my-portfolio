        <h3>Policy Research</h3>
        <p>Through extensive international experience, I've gained different perspectives and methodological approaches for addressing key policy questions 
          with quantitative and qualitative data, communicating to various audiences, and generating impact.<br><br>  
          For UNESCO, I've contributed towards monitoring equity and quality of education with policy notes for the GEM report, gender report and spotlight series.
          For the MoE Peru, I've analyzed trends in PISA 2000-2022, the impact of COVID-19, and differential school effectiveness. 
          For UNICEF Kyrgyzstan, I've drafted the Education Sector Analysis. 
          For OSF Armenia, I've examined equity in learning outcomes with TIMSS and national survey data. 
          For UNICEF Rwanda, I've developed a framework for monitoring teacher policy with equity, efficiency, and quality indicators.<br><br> 

          At OUCEA, Iâ€™ve assessed marker reliability of high-stakes examinations for Pearson, the impact of linear and modular examinations for Ofqual, 
          and the predictability of examinations for the State Examination Commission.</p>

        <img src="images/data.png" alt="Data" class="circle-img" />
        <h3>Data Solutions</h3>
        <p>I am skilled in the analysis of large-scale complex data, working collaboratively with GitHub + Slack, developing R tools along with 
          learning resources (eg., manuals, videos) for data analysis, statistical models for testing theory, assessing causal inferences, 
          generating data for policy monitoring, analyzing geospatial data and producing data visualizations and storytelling.<br><br>  

          For UNESCO WIDE, I've produced data for monitoring inequalities in learning outcomes (SDG 4.1.1). For the MoE Spain, I've developed the 
          R package 'mefdind' (video) with web scrapping tools for searching and reading education data with national indicators.  
          As OECD Fellow, I've developed the R package 'intsvy' with analysis and visualization tools for international assessment data. 
          For the Center for Policing Equity, I've reviewed statistical modeling of racially-biased police abuse with the National Justice Database.</p>

        <img src="images/capacity.png" alt="Capacity" class="circle-img" />
        <h3>Capacity Building</h3>
        <p>I've approached capacity building with a policy orientation. In addition to lectures, assignments, and hands-on sessions, participants 
          are provided with an analytical framework for formulating and analyzing own policy questions as part of a research project. 
          Different tools by skill level are offered for the analysis of  complex data.<br><br> 
          I've led data trainings on large-scale assessments for national officials at MoEs (eg., Dominican Republic, Honduras, Peru, UK, Ukraine) 
          and at major educational conferences (eg., AERA, CIES, EARLI, ECER). For UNICEF Rwanda, I've developed a self-paced online training package
          on teacher data for policy monitoring.<br><br>  
          
          At the University of Oxford, I've trained graduate students at the Social Sciences Division on multilevel modeling and structural equation modeling.</p>
